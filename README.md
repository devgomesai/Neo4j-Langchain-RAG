# üß† LangChain x Neo4j x Ollama | Knowledge Graph from Text

This project demonstrates how to build a **structured knowledge graph** from unstructured text using:

- üß± **Neo4j** for storing and visualizing the graph  
- üß† **LangChain's LLMGraphTransformer** for graph extraction  
- üí¨ **Ollama (Gemma3)** as the local LLM backend  
- üß™ **LangChain Experimental** modules for graph transformation  

---

## üìå Features

- Converts raw text into entities and relationships  
- Automatically generates graph nodes and edges using LLM  
- Inserts the knowledge graph into a running Neo4j database  
- Uses `Ollama` to run `Gemma3` locally for cost-effective LLM processing  

---

## üì¶ Dependencies

```bash
pip install langchain langchain-core langchain-neo4j langchain-experimental langchain-ollama python-dotenv
````

Also make sure:

* Neo4j is installed and running (AuraDB or local)
* Ollama is installed and the `gemma3` model is pulled:

```bash
ollama pull gemma3
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

1. Create a `.env` file with your Neo4j credentials:

```env
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_password
```

2. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## üß™ Example Text Used

> Isaac Newton, born in 1643, was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, and author who is widely recognized as one of the most influential scientists of all time.
> He formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation, laying the groundwork for classical mechanics.
> His work, *Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica*, published in 1687, remains one of the most important scientific books ever written.
> Newton also made pioneering contributions to optics and developed a form of calculus independently around the same time as Leibniz.
> He served as president of the Royal Society and was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705.
