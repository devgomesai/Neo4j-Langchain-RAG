Isaac Newton, born in 1643, was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, and author who is widely recognized as one of the most influential scientists of all time.  
He formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation, laying the groundwork for classical mechanics.  
His work, "Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica," published in 1687, remains one of the most important scientific books ever written.  
Newton also made pioneering contributions to optics and developed a form of calculus independently around the same time as Leibniz.  
He served as president of the Royal Society and was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705.
